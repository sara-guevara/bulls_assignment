Creating new NBA bulls team

Repository contains:
- 4 main RMD files.
 1st: one is clean, tidy, transform and explore the data.
 2nd: Team analysis and creating of statistical model
 3rd: Applying the model to the player statistics and selecting the top 5 players
 4th: Copy of the final report
 
There are raw and processed data files in the data folder
There are the final figures used in the report in the figs folder. 

There is some rough analysis in the clearning.R folder. 
Docs has a word document with a rough outline on how the team and player data was cleaned

I had issues putting the RMD folders in the clearning and analysis folders - the code didn't run properly when I did that. 

I assume I didn't set the root directory properly but I am not sure how I should have done it. 

There is a root directly on teh main folder and everything in here has been attached and updated and pushed through to github.
